## 📖 About

The **Employee Management System** is a console-based application developed using **Python** and **MySQL**.
It allows users to perform complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on employee records stored in a MySQL database, managed visually through **phpMyAdmin**.

This project demonstrates:
- Python Programming with modular functions
- MySQL Database Connectivity
- Parameterized SQL Queries (SQL Injection prevention)
- CRUD Operations implementation
- Input Validation and Error Handling

> Designed as a beginner-friendly portfolio project — suitable for software developer interviews.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Add Employee
- ✅ View All Employees
- ✅ Search Employee by ID
- ✅ Update Employee Salary
- ✅ Delete Employee
- ✅ MySQL Database Integration
- ✅ Parameterized SQL Queries (SQL Injection safe)
- ✅ Input Validation & Error Handling
- ✅ Interactive Menu-Driven Application

## 🗄️ Database Design

**Database Name:** `employee_db`  
**Table Name:** `employees`

| Column | Data Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| id | INT (PRIMARY KEY) | Unique employee identifier |
| name | VARCHAR(50) | Employee full name |
| department | VARCHAR(50) | Department name |
| salary | DECIMAL(10,2) | Employee salary |
| email | VARCHAR(100) | Employee email address |

**SQL Script:**

```sql
CREATE DATABASE employee_db;
USE employee_db;

CREATE TABLE employees (
    id         INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name       VARCHAR(50),
    department VARCHAR(50),
    salary     DECIMAL(10, 2),
    email      VARCHAR(100)
);
```

> 💡 Run this in **phpMyAdmin** → SQL tab at `http://localhost/phpmyadmin/`
